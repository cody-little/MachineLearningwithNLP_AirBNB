# MachineLearningwithNLP_AirBNB
A machine learning project comparing textual feature representation methods to classify AirBNB price ranges

## Summary

This is a project that utilizes cross disciplinary approaches to understand methods of predicting price ranges on short term rentals. Using a combination of text representation methods from computational linguistics and metadata I compare how different feauture spaces effect outcome metrics along with their level of computational effeciency. Specifically this project:

* Predict a multiclass price range for AirBNB short term rental spaces in New York City (low, medium, high)
* Compare bag-of-words and SpaCy word embeddings text feature representation for outcome metrics and computational effeciency
* Train, Validate, and optimize the best classifiers and feature spaces for the task using a hybrid representation space of text and metadata
